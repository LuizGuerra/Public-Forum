        <h2>V1 - We value psychological safety and trust between technical and business stakeholders for effective Technical Debt Management.</h2>
        <p>
          Psychological safety<span class="footnote-number">1</span> is essential for effective Technical Debt Management as it implies that there is no risk of retribution. Instead, people can talk openly about Technical Debt and how it was introduced without concern about negative career impact. Equally important is building trust between technical and business stakeholders: they both have legitimate concerns about the software being developed, and they need to mutually understand and respect these concerns by working together to address them. Accountability translates into appointing concrete roles to manage Technical Debt instead of blaming other stakeholders.

        <h2>V2 - We value simple, actionable, value-based communication of Technical Debt to all stakeholders over excessive, minute, overwhelming details.</h2>
        <p>
          When communicating Technical Debt information to the development team and even more so to management, clear communications and supporting information should be minimally complex and focus on actionable points. Although metrics, data, and trend plots have a role in effective Technical Debt Management, an overload of fragmented information may confuse rather than enable prioritized decision-making. Communication, especially with management, should also emphasize information that impacts business value more than any single metric or set of metrics. The key is not to over-simplify Technical Debt information, but instead to foster a practical and actionable Technical Debt Management approach that is clearly understood by developers and management.

        <h2>V3 - We value transparency, explainability, and replicability in the identification, measurement, and prioritization of Technical Debt.</h2>
        <p>
          The methods by which Technical Debt is identified, measured, and prioritized should not be obscured behind complicated tooling, esoteric rules, and undisclosed data sets. Instead, Technical Debt items should be traced to specific data sources, where measurement and prioritization rules should be open and explainable to all stakeholders

        <h2>V4 - We value both objective and subjective data collection along with research methods to identify, measure, and prioritize Technical Debt over single-method approaches.</h2>
        <p>
          Technical Debt items may take many different forms, therefore, identifying and measuring them requires incorporating multiple mono- or inter-disciplinary approaches (e.g., from economics or psychology), metrics, and benchmarks that might differ for each form of Technical Debt depending on the context. Relevant data may be of several different types, ranging from quantitative metrics to qualitative data (e.g., open-ended survey responses and interviews that capture opinions on the severity/priority of Technical Debt items or the probability of specific components changing in the future).

        <h2>V5 - We value software architecture understanding across the team as part of effective Technical Debt Management.</h2>
        <p>
          A precondition to understanding Technical Debt items, their consequences, and the effects of repaying them is understanding the current architecture and how it has evolved over time. The entire team (developers, managers and other stakeholders) should share such an understanding to enable them to align and check the conformance of the architecture implementation. This should also occur in parallel with maintaining code quality, and it often results in improving it. Teams should consider architecture understanding as an essential part of development competency as well as a means to reason about business value and technical tradeoffs.
